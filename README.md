 Web Scrapte FOr NYC_Apartments

Built a web scraper using Selenium and Python to collect information about NYC apartments that follow the user’s requirements. 

The user was looking for:
- a two-bedroom apartment, approximately 
- a twenty-minute commute from Madison Square Garden, and 
- a maximum rent of $5,000

After filtering the live website, the page yields 44 pages of results (as of May 8th 2022) and produces a text file that holds the URLs of all the page’s results. Using the URLs in the text file, the output in the console prints the information of all the rentals: address, price, broker fee (if one), broker name, # of bedrooms/bathrooms, and square footage.
